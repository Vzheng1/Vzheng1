<h3>About Me:</h3>

I am currently a sophomore at Stony Brook University, studying Computer Science and Applied Math & Statistics. 

I am planning to pursue a career in ML, Data Science, and AI!


Some fun facts about me:
* I enjoy crocheting stuffed animals and small trinkets
* Watching Chinese dramas is my favorite past time

<h3>Recently Completed: Academic Papers Embeddings Pipeline with Axle Informatics </h3>

**Business Context**: "How can we best convert PDF data to text for a training data set while maintaining sufficient accuracy?". We want to find the most accurate and efficient parser to convert academic PDFs to text to train an academic RAG model that can quickly and accurately provide researchers with information about academic papers.

**What We Did**: 
* Created PDF parsing procedure to transfer data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv">arXiv</a> dataset into useable formats for the model.
* Evaluated parser performance by comparing parsed data to ground truth data
  * Compared both traditional and AI parsers like Nougat, PDFPlumber, Makrer, PDFMiner, PyMuPDF, LlamaParse, DocTR, Open Parse
  * Selection criteria included parsing time, output form, handling of special features (images, equations, tables), and **parsing accuracy**
  * Parsing accuracy was determined using cosine similarity

**Tools**:
* Github
* VSCode through Polus Notebooks Hub
* Gsutil

**Result**:
* All tested parsers had a cosine similarity above 0.90 with the ground truth abstract with PDFPlumber being the only parser to be below 0.95
* The greatest determinant in top performance was a parser's ability to parse out equations, tables, and images accurately and efficiently.
* The top performers were LlamaParse (AI) and PyMuPDF (Traditional OCR)
